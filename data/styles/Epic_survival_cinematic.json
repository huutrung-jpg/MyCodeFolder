  "visual_style": "Live-action prehistoric survival with a naturalistic docu-drama tone and epic vistas. Lighting: sun/overcast, fire/ember glow, moonlight; smoke, dust, and fog used as organic diffusion—no modern fixtures. Earthy palette (ochre, umber, charcoal, moss green; cool dawn/blue hour). Weathered skin with dirt, sweat, scars; cracked hands; tangled hair; ritual pigments (charcoal/ochre). Authentic props (bone/stone/wood tools, sinew lashings), hand-stitched hides/fibers; no metal or plastic. Camera: real-lens behavior 18–85 mm, low near-ground angles, shoulder/handheld with gentle drift; slow push-ins; occasional crane/aerial for migrations; shallow DOF for close work, deep focus for landscapes; 24 fps, 180° shutter, subtle film grain. Sound: rich ambience (wind, grass, insects, water, distant animals, fire crackle); foley of leather/stone/bone; minimal percussive score (skin drums, bone flutes). Grading: restrained contrast, natural skin tones, patina of age. (Negative Prompt: black bars, top bars, bottom bars, letterbox, pillarbox, cinema bars, mattes, padding, blur background, solid-color borders, vignette edges, frame border, watermark, captions, subtitles, UI overlay). Aspect ratio (16:9 or 9:16) EDGE-TO-EDGE — ABSOLUTELY NO borders/letterboxing/pillarboxing/mattes. Scale = COVER/FILL. If framing mismatches (16:9 or 9:16), CENTER-CROP to fit; DO NOT pad. Deliver full-frame only; safe area 100%; no text/watermarks. NOT CGI, NOT animated, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized, NOT 3D, NOT render."
