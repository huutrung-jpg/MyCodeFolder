  "visual_style": "3D CGI realistic style, hyper-detailed character models with lifelike proportions and anatomically correct features. Physically-based rendering (PBR) with accurate material response: realistic skin, cloth, metal, wood, and organic surfaces. High-resolution textures, subsurface scattering, ray-traced reflections, global illumination, and cinematic depth of field. Natural lighting setups (sunlight, studio, volumetric light) with accurate shadows. Realistic hair and cloth physics for authentic motion. Style reference: Pixar realism, DreamWorks, Disney modern CGI films. NOT live-action, NOT 2D, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized, NOT hand-drawn. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no top or bottom borders, no black bars."
