  "visual_style": "Experimental art film style, abstract and surreal imagery with unconventional framing, unusual camera angles, and non-linear visual storytelling. Real actors or real objects are filmed but presented in dreamlike, fragmented, or symbolic ways. Lighting can be stark, colored, or high-contrast, often creating painterly or theatrical moods. Emphasis on atmosphere, emotion, and metaphor rather than narrative clarity. May include slow motion, extreme close-ups, or distorted perspectives. Style reference: arthouse cinema and avant-garde short films. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no top or bottom borders, no black bars. NOT CGI, NOT animated, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized, NOT 3D, NOT render."
