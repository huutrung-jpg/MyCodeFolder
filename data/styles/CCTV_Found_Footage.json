  "visual_style": "CCTV / Found footage style, filmed as if captured by surveillance cameras or handheld amateur devices. Realistic human appearance with unpolished, raw visuals. Low resolution, slight pixelation, compression artifacts, time stamps, and static noise. Camera angles are fixed (for CCTV) or shaky and unstable (for handheld). Lighting is natural or harsh from existing sources like streetlights, indoor fluorescents, or headlights. Atmosphere is tense, gritty, and authentic, evoking security feeds or discovered footage. Style reference: horror found footage films and real surveillance recordings. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no top or bottom borders, no black bars. NOT CGI, NOT animated, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized, NOT 3D, NOT render."
