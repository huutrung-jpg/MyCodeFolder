  "visual_style": "2D animation style, flat perspective with clean outlines, bold line art, and simplified forms. Characters and objects are illustrated with consistent cel shading or flat coloring, no depth simulation. Movements are smooth but intentionally stylized, frame-by-frame animation with strong silhouettes. Backgrounds kept simple or hand-drawn, emphasizing shapes and colors rather than realism. Aesthetic inspired by traditional 2D animated films and TV series. NOT 3D, NOT CGI, NOT photorealistic, NOT live-action. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no borders, no black bars."
