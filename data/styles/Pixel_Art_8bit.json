  "visual_style": "Pixel art retro game style, low-resolution 8-bit or 16-bit graphics with blocky pixels clearly visible. Characters and objects simplified into chunky pixel forms with limited color palettes, sharp outlines, and nostalgic arcade aesthetics. Animation choppy but stylized, mimicking old NES/SNES era games. Backgrounds tiled or grid-based with repeating patterns. Emphasize retro charm, minimal shading, and nostalgic game feel. Style reference: classic Nintendo and Sega pixel games. NOT 3D, NOT realistic, NOT cinematic, NOT photorealistic. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no top or bottom borders, no black bars."
