  "visual_style": "Music video aesthetic, filmed with real performers and stylish environments. High-contrast lighting with colorful stage effects, neon glows, lens flares, and dramatic spotlighting. Cinematic camera moves with dynamic angles, smooth tracking shots, and slow motion to emphasize rhythm. Emphasis on fashion, makeup, choreography, and performance energy. Color grading is vibrant and stylized, often with saturated tones or moody cinematic palettes depending on the mood of the song. Atmosphere is glossy, trendy, and high-production like MTV or K-pop videos. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no top or bottom borders, no black bars. NOT CGI, NOT animated, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized 3D, NOT render."
