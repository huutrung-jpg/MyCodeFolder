  "visual_style": "Film noir black and white style, filmed with real actors and realistic settings. High-contrast monochrome imagery with deep shadows and sharp highlights. Strong use of chiaroscuro lighting, Venetian blinds, smoke, and rain-soaked streets to create dramatic tension. Characters appear in trench coats, fedoras, or period-accurate attire, with expressive gestures and subtle emotional nuance. Cinematic depth of field, moody atmosphere, and classic noir framing with tilted angles and shadow play. Style reference: 1940s–1950s noir cinema. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no top or bottom borders, no black bars. NOT CGI, NOT animated, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized, NOT 3D, NOT render."
