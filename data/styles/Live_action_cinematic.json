  "visual_style": "Live-action cinematic style, filmed with real actors and authentic environments. Natural human appearance with realistic skin tones, hair, and clothing. Captured using professional cinema cameras with high resolution, shallow depth of field, and cinematic framing. Lighting based on real-world conditions: golden hour sunlight, soft indoor ambient, or dramatic studio setups. Realistic lens effects: lens flares, natural bokeh, slight film grain. Movements and expressions are genuine human performances, exactly like feature films. Style reference: mainstream Hollywood cinema and high-end commercials. High resolution, ultra sharp detail, cinematic color grading, balanced natural tones. Aspect ratio 16:9 EDGE-TO-EDGE — ABSOLUTELY NO borders, NO letterboxing/pillarboxing, NO mattes. Always scale = COVER (FILL FRAME). If source framing mismatches 16:9, CENTER-CROP to fit; DO NOT pad. Deliver full-frame images only; safe area 100%; no text overlays or watermarks. NOT CGI, NOT animated, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized, NOT 3D, NOT render."
