  "visual_style": "Vintage retro film look, filmed with real actors and authentic environments. Warm faded color grading, slight film grain, dust, scratches, and subtle vignette to mimic old film reels. Natural skin tones with a nostalgic hue, softer focus, and reduced contrast. Lighting styled after classic cinema: tungsten indoor lights, warm sunlight, or neon retro glow. Camera movement may include zooms, pans, or slight jitter typical of analog film. Style reference: 70s–90s cinema, old home movies, retro commercials. Aspect ratio 16:9 full frame, no top or bottom borders, no black bars. NOT CGI, NOT animated, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized, NOT 3D, NOT render."
